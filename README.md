# NETFLIX-SHOW-ANLYSIER

A data-driven project to analyze various Netflix shows using Python. This repository provides insights into Netflix content, including genre distribution, ratings, release trends, and more, utilizing data visualization and analysis tools.

## Features

- Import and clean Netflix show datasets
- Analyze show metadata (genre, release year, ratings, etc.)
- Generate insightful data visualizations
- Explore trends and patterns in Netflix content
- Ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, (optionally: Plotly, Scikit-learn)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

    cd NETFLIX-SHOW-ANLYSIER
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install the main libraries manually:)*  
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the analysis notebook files and run the cells.

## Usage

- Place the Netflix dataset (usually a CSV file) in the project directory or as instructed in the notebook.
- Open the main analysis notebook (e.g., `Netflix-Analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter.
- Follow the step-by-step analysis, or modify the code for your own insights!

## Example Visualizations

- Genre distribution of Netflix shows
- Year-wise release trends
