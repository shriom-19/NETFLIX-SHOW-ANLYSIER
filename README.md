# NETFLIX-SHOW-ANLYSIER

NETFLIX-SHOW-ANLYSIER is a Python-based project designed to analyze and visualize Netflix shows data. This repository offers tools to clean, explore, and extract insights from Netflix’s publicly available datasets, such as show genres, release years, ratings, and regional availability. The project includes ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis, with clear data visualizations and statistics to help users understand patterns and trends in Netflix’s content library.

**Key Features:**
- Import, clean, and preprocess Netflix show datasets (CSV format)
- Analyze show genres, release years, ratings, countries, and age restrictions
- Visualize data with graphs and charts (genre distribution, release trends, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook-based workflow for stepwise and interactive exploration
- Simple, extensible codebase for custom analyses

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for charting
- Jupyter Notebook for interactivity

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or install pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
3. Place your Netflix dataset (CSV) in the project directory.
